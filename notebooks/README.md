# Notebooks

This folder contains demonstration notebooks showing how to:

1. Explore the input healthcare query data.
2. Generate LLM responses using the `collect_responses.py` module.
3. Process readability and sentiment scores with `process_responses.py`.
4. Visualize outputs for analysis.

Notebooks run on **sample inputs only** and do not include model outputs or sensitive data.
